# News Score: Fake or Fact #
A proposal to instantly analyze the veracity of a news story.

<blockquote>As the vilest Writer has his Readers, so the greatest Liar has his Believers; and it often happens, that if a Lie be believ’d only for an Hour, it has done its Work, and there is no farther occasion for it. Falsehood flies, and the Truth comes limping after it; so that when Men come to be undeceiv’d, it is too late; the Jest is over, and the Tale has had its Effect.<br>

Problem: By the time a fact-checker has debunked a fake news story, the hoax has already spread virally thruout social media. The fact-check will always arrive to late to control the infestation.

Solution: The key to preventing an epidemic outbreak is quick containment. Human fact-checkers will always be critical. But many <a href="https://github.com/hearvox/Research/blob/master/News-Trust/news-verification-checklists.md">fact vs. fake flags</a> can be instantly detected via existing APIs: What's the quality of links in and to the story and its site? How long has the site been active? Is the article's syntax consistent with clickbait?
