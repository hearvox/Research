# News Score: Fact vs. Fake #
NOTE: DRAFT

A proposal to instantly analyze the veracity of a news story.

Fact-checks can't stop the viral spread of fake news. A fact-check arrives long after the hoax has infested social sites.

To control an epidemic outbreak, quick containment is the key. Fact-checking will always be a human process, but machines can help, instantly answering critical fact-checking questions. 

With only these rapid results alone, we could reliably estimate the credibillty of a story and website. For example: Is the site listed in Editor &amp; Publisher's DataBook? Is it in PolitiFact's Fake News Almanac? What is the Page Authority of the article's external links?

Existing API services can answer of <a href="https://github.com/hearvox/Research/blob/master/News-Trust/news-verification-checklists.md">fact vs. fake</a> questions.

Fakes news is not a new problem. The centuries-old saying, "A lie can travel halfway around the world before the truth can get its boots on," <a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2014/07/13/truth/">has its roots</a> in the 1700s:
<blockquote>As the vilest Writer has his Readers, so the greatest Liar has his Believers; and it often happens, that if a Lie be believ’d only for an Hour, it has done its Work, and there is no farther occasion for it. Falsehood flies, and the Truth comes limping after it; so that when Men come to be undeceiv’d, it is too late; the Jest is over, and the Tale has had its Effect.<br>
<cite>Jonathan Swift, The Examiner newspaper (1710)</blockquote>
  
Maybe this is the century we finally have the tools to fight the fake news infestation.
