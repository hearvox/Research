# CredScore: Fact vs. Fake #
NOTE: DRAFT

Fact-checks can't stop fake news. A fact-check will always arrive hours or days after the hoax virally spread through social sites.

So you do you control an epidemic outbreak? You act quickly to contain it. From just a news story's URL, computers can do enough <a href="https://github.com/hearvox/Research/blob/master/News-Trust/news-verification-checklists.md">fact-checking steps</a> to instantly and reliably estimate its credibility.

Simple checks like: Is the website in the <a href="http://www.editorandpublisher.com/databook/data/?djoPage=search_details&djoPid=25874">Editor &amp; Publisher DataBook</a<? Or is it in <a href="https://infogram.com/politifacts-fake-news-almanac-1gew2vjdxl912nj">PolitiFact's Fake News Almanac</a>, the <a hrwef="http://www.fakenewscodex.com/">Fake News Codex</a>, or any curated <a href="https://github.com/hearvox/Research/blob/master/News-Trust/fake-news-site-lists.md">fake new site list</a>? 
  
No one indictator will be conclusive. Instead dozens of weighted factors will generate a CredScore. Content checks for plagiarism and sentiment analysis. Tech checks for HTML and security standards. Network checks for link quality and page authority.  

## The Cred Badge of Courage ##
If a social site lets users auto-submit a shared link, they'd get its CredScore before they posted — which, if low, they may not do at all. Users could also submit links for all their social shares to get their average CredScore — whihc, if high, they could display their number as a badge of cred honor.

## You can run, but you can't hide ##
Initial tests are already yeilding statically significant differences between fact vs. fake news sites, e.g., the year a site went online, the percentage of complex words in an article, and the number of its accessibility errors.




People could submit a URL for which we'd return a CredScore, 0–100. Social sites could permit users to auto-submit a story before they share, or to submit all their links to get an average score for the stories they share. 

Those with high avergages might make their scores public, a source of pride. Maybe the social sites themselves would publish the average of all their users, a badge of the site's social resposibility.

Fakes news is not a new problem. The centuries-old saying, "A lie can travel halfway around the world before the truth can get its boots on," <a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2014/07/13/truth/">has its roots</a> in the 1700s:
<blockquote>As the vilest Writer has his Readers, so the greatest Liar has his Believers; and it often happens, that if a Lie be believ’d only for an Hour, it has done its Work, and there is no farther occasion for it. Falsehood flies, and the Truth comes limping after it; so that when Men come to be undeceiv’d, it is too late; the Jest is over, and the Tale has had its Effect.<br>
<cite>Jonathan Swift, The Examiner newspaper (1710)</blockquote>
  
Maybe this is the century we finally have the tools to fight the fake news infestation.
