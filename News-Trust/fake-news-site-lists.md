PolitiFact's Fake News Almanac (2017-11-07 / 325 sites)  
https://infogram.com/politifacts-fake-news-almanac-1gew2vjdxl912nj

<blockquote>To help you better sort out fact from fiction on the Internet we created this list of websites where we've found  deliberately false or fake stories. This is by no means a complete list of offenders. Nor does it mean every post on these websites is fake. But in most cases, these sites work hard to fool readers, and you should take that into consideration if should you see a link being shared from one.</blockquote>

So long as social media allows for the rapid spread of information, manipulative entities will seek to cash in on the rapid spread of misinformation. Perhaps the most egregious of the many nonsense peddlers on social media are fake news sites, so here we offer a guide to several of the most frequent (and unapologetic) hoax purveyors cluttering up newsfeeds everywhere.</blockquote>

## Fake News Codex  ##
The Fake News Codex (2018-01-01) 
http://www.fakenewscodex.com/

<blockquote>This site was created to identify “news” sites that are fake, extremely misleading, or satirical.  There’s no shortage of similar resources purporting to list fake news sites but they are often infrequently updated, politically slanted, or difficult to use.

The Fake News Codex does not include sites that merely have a clear political or ideological bias – Daily Kos and Breitbart will not appear here.

We do include sites that are not necessarily intended to mislead (such as The Onion and its legion of imitators), but that can be misunderstood by naive readers.  These are marked with the “satire” tag.</blockquote>
