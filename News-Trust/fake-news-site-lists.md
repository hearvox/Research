PolitiFact's Fake News Almanac (2017-11-07)  
https://infogram.com/politifacts-fake-news-almanac-1gew2vjdxl912nj

<blockquote>To help you better sort out fact from fiction on the Internet we created this list of websites where we've found  deliberately false or fake stories. This is by no means a complete list of offenders. Nor does it mean every post on these websites is fake. But in most cases, these sites work hard to fool readers, and you should take that into consideration if should you see a link being shared from one.</blockquote>

<blockquote>This is a list of fake news sites. These sites intentionally, but not necessarily solely, publish hoaxes and disinformation for purposes other than news satire.
